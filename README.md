NEST : Your Second Brain
---
Why NEST? <br>
NEST for your thoughts: A second brain in which you can immerse in.

We are creating an immersive virtual reality second brain which will empower your human brain to focus on the things that matter.

## Inspiration
[(Back to contentsüëÜüèª)](#contents)
<p> It is a common known fact that a human‚Äôs brain is supposed to be processing information and not spend the power in storing or searching for information. So the aim is to create a second brain, something like roam research but instead in VR.<br>
 The issue with roam research is that you can‚Äôt have an immersive experience with roam research, i.e. you can interact and be inside your ‚Äúsecond brain‚Äù and also you are restricted by the screen size. We are trying to create an experience where you are not restricted by anything except your imagination.

Database of the History -> Flask Server to Host the Database & Use of InterSystems API -> Creation of AR/VR Front end to display in C# -> Visualizing the History in AR

## Sponsor Specific Documentation
 *DRW*:  Ever since the inception of data visualisation, we have only considered visualising data on a screen which is a 2d plane. We are always trying to fit multi-dimensions of data on a single plane but this never had us immerse in the data.
So, we are trying to do data visualisation in a virtual reality environment. Not only will it give you an infinite canvas in a 360-degree room to analyse your data but this, in my opinion, will also help create a paradigm shift in the fields of data visualisation.

<br>

*InterSystems*: Used InterSystems API for DB and API management. It is a common known fact that a human‚Äôs brain is supposed to be processing information and not spend the power in storing or searching for information. So the aim is to create a second brain, something like roam research but instead in VR.

The issue with roam research is that you can‚Äôt have an immersive experience with roam research, i.e. you can interact and be inside your ‚Äúsecond brain‚Äù and also you are restricted by the screen size. We are trying to create an experience where you are not restricted by anything except your imagination.

The second brain can have the possibility to cluster certain important info together, create links between the information and edit information.

Since we‚Äôll need a dataset representative of your brain, and we are sceptical of inserting chips inside our brain(xD), we are logging the things we did over our computer ( just for the MVP of the hackathon) and then we can target certain specific items.   

As an extension, this can also be a massive productivity booster, e.g. we can integrate some machine learning recommendation to show a recommendation dashboard alongside the brain.



# Installation
[(Back to contentsüëÜüèª)](#contents)

### To start the Flask Server

* It is advised to use a `pipenv` as the already installed versions of vlc might interfere with the ones in the dependencies

* Use the command `pip3 install pipenv`

* Now `cd` into server directory via the `cd services_prep/`

* Next, install the dependencies by using the command `pipenv install`


## Tech Stack (Expected)
[(Back to contentsüëÜüèª)](#contents)

* Flask Backend
* Augmented Reality C# Frontend.
* SQLite DB.
* Docker
* AWS
* InterSystems API
